				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">What is this site?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: left;">
				The page you are viewing is a simple stub contained in every copy of the software. Browsers may use it to connect to any public NeoPeer network with web access enabled.
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Why is this called an "antiplatform"?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: left;">
				Everyone who downloads the software has a copy of the jump stub (this page). The networks accessed from this stub have their own federated jump hosts. The content within those networks is decentralized / hosted by the viewers themselves. In short, the platform model is inverted.
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">How does this differ from other freedom loving projects?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: left;">
				Oblivious transfer protocol (OTP), immutable encoding, multi-layered decentralization, and mininal experience required to deploy. A secondary effect of the OTP is it guards against the invasion of privacy by cloud services such as Cloudflare. 
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">What is oblivious transfer?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: left;">
				A peer puts multiple pieces of content through an equation and a single ciphered piece falls out the other end. The peer who performed the math does not know which of the pieces came out the other side. This encoded piece is returned to the requestor to decode. i.e. the server does not know precisely what was requested. 
				</p>	

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">What is immutable encoding?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: left;">
				Different kinds of content are encoded together in such a way where an attempt to separate them will break the ability to serve any of them to peers. This resists censorship and helps content hosts claim "safe harbor" legal protection.
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Who can launch a network?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center;">
				Anyone.
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Who controls who can post to a network?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: left;">
				The network admin (person who created a network and therefore has the keys) can add/remove authorized authors. The network is otherwise decentralized. i.e. if the network admin vanishes the network will continue to operate.
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Is there a flowchart?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center;">
				<a href="whitepapers.html">Yes.</a>
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Why isn't this a thing anywhere else?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center;">
				There is no money in liberating communication. Also, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-laws-of-australia-will-trump-the-laws-of-mathematics-turnbull/" target="_blank">math is hard</a>. 
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Can you help me remove content or censor a network?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center;">
				No.
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">What if I have legal complaints?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: center;">
				Can't help you. Won't help you. Go play with blocks. 
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Why can't you help me with legal complaints?</h3>
				<p style="text-align: left;">
				This page is a stub. Communication with other networks cannot be detected by it. Network lookups are done via OTP using immutable encoding which picks up the network registrations from a blockchain. Concordantly, can't and won't.
				</p>
