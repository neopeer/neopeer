**Caution:**
This repository is still in development. 
Use at your own risk. 

**Installation on Debian/Devuan:**
apt-get update && apt-get install aptitude
aptitude install make gcc g++ gdb libgmp-dev codelite
;then be sure to download the repository using git

**Execution:**
Open CodeLite
Select C/C++ Development, GCC at compiler wizard, prefer tabs for indentation.
Use codelite to open the workspace in /code/projects/linux/codelite/
Compile, build, run.

**Debugging:**
Debugger -> Start/Continue Debugger

**Enhanced Debugging:**
Add the following to the compiler/linker options:
  -fsanitize=undefined,address

**WARNING on Enhanced Debugging:**
These checks can be glitchy if you run the debug executable without the debugger. Specifically, it's not uncommon to see an infinite loop of: AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL. This error is a direct consequence of declaring static variables globally for the linker *and* executing under the aforementioned conditions. To prevent confusion these extra checks are disabled by default.
