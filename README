This repository is still in development. 
Use at your own risk. 

Installation on Debian:
apt-get update && apt-get install aptitude
aptitude install make gcc g++ gdb libgmp-dev codelite
;then be sure to download the repository using git

Execution:
Open CodeLite
Select C/C++ Development, GCC at compiler wizard, prefer tabs for indentation.
Use codelite to open the workspace in /code/projects/linux/codelite/
Compile, build, run.

Debugging:
Debugger -> Start/Continue Debugger

Enhanced Debugging:
Add the following to the compiler/linker options:
  -fsanitize=undefined,address

WARNING on Enhanced Debugging: 
These checks can be glitchy if you run the debug executable without the debugger. Specifically, it's not uncommon to see an infinite loop of: AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL. This error is a direct consequence of declaring static variables globally for the linker *and* executing under the aforementioned conditions. To prevent confusion these extra checks are disabled by default.
